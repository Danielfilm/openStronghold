# openStronghold
An open source version of the classic game Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader in Java

I have no idea what Im doing here

1. we use camelBack notation for enum variables, variables and methods. 
2. CamelCase for classes, interfaces and enums
3. no fucking CAPS for anything. 
4. a '{' never goes on a new line.
5. try to keep methods on a one page length.
6. use singletons for entry points
7. use libgdx provided classes and methods as much as possible.
8. comment your shit and use meaningful names for everything
9. try to limit your classes to a one-trick-pony type. layers of abstraction exist for a reason
10. try to think on how other people use your classes. encapsulation, final and abstract keywords do exist
11. use static with care.
12. more to come...
